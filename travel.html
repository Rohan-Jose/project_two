	  <h3>The World is Diverse</h3>
	  <p class="travelintro">The reason why I grew up in Ghana is because my parents moved there around a few years before the year
	  2000 (I don't really remember when). And because of this, every year I would travel back to India
	  to visit my grandparents and other extended family members. The beautiful thing was, Ghana and India
	  are so far away that there were no connecting flights, so we would spend a week over at a country of our choice.
	  This is where my love for travelling began.</p>
	  <p>Some of the most breathtaking countries I have ever been to are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a>, 
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</a>,
	  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a>. Here are some of the unique things about these
	  countries that I enjoyed when I visited.</p>

	<section id="singapore">
	  <h3>Singapore, the richest island city-state.</h3>
	  <p>In my opinion, one of the most impressive countries has to be Singapore. You could drive across the entire island country
	  in just half an hour! But what makes this tiny country special is that even though it's so small, it is an extremely
	  developed, clean, and culturally diverse nation. With a whopping 4 national languages (English, Malay, Tamil, and Mandarin)
	  just on this little island while being incredibly developed and one of the safest countries.</p>

	<section id="turkey">
	  <h3> Turkey, the only country that has a city on 2 continents</h3>
	  <p>Turkey has been an important nation both culturally and economically. With its deep centuries-old history and amazing cuisine,
	  it is also home to the only city in the world that lies on 2 continents: Istanbul. Istanbul has been such an important place in
	  human civilation for centuries even before the era of the Roman Empire looking for a new Rome that settled there. This city was the
	  lifeline in the connection between the Western civilizations (Europe) to the Eastern civilizations (Asia).</p>

	<section id="italy">
	  <h3>We all know Italy</h3>
	  <p>It's actually been so many years since I travelled to Italy so I don't remember much. But this is Italy, it's one country that
	  needs no explanation or description on how beautiful it is in every aspect. I remember eating a pizza there for lunch like everyday
	  and to be honest, Italian pizza isn't unhealthy. Some cities worth mentioning to visit are: Rome, Venice, Naples, Florence, Milan,
	  Turin, and Pisa. Here's a fun video showing a basic description of what Italy is like, as well as some fun facts:</p>

	<section id="southafrica">
	<h3>South Africa's natural beauty</h3>
	<p>Probably, one of the most naturally beautiful countries I've every visited has to be South Africa. The bright red warmth of the
	Southern African sun is, surprisingly, so unique and breathtaking. You can't go to South Africa and not go on a Safari to witness
	vastly unique and untamed animals in their natural habitat as you drive along. But of course, the most naturally unique city in South Africa
	in my opinion has to be Cape Town. A culturally diverse city near the southern-most tip of the entire continent, Cape Town's crown jewel
	is the iconic Table Mountain. A glorious mountain that immediately cuts off at a specific altitiude, giving the city a shine of uniqueness
	and having its people proud. I think if anyone wants to visit the heart of Africa, they must visit South Africa.</p>
