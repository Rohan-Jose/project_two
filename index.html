      <h3>A bit of who I am</h3>
      <p>My name is Rohan Jose. I am a 2nd Year student majoring in ITM
	  at <a href="https://www.iit.edu/">Illinois Tech</a> (obviously). Right now, I am living on campus while attending 
	  online for all 5 of the classes I'm taking this semester.</p>

	  <h3>Ghana</h3>
      <p><span class="firstletter">I</span> grew up in the capital city of Accra, in the heart of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana">Ghana</a>, a very 
	  lovely little country situated in West Africa. Growing up has always been a 
	  mix of so many cultures for me. Especially since I'm Indian by nationality
	  but spent my entire life experiencing the life of a Ghanaian. In fact, this 
	  has created a newfound love for a fusion of these 2 extremely far away yet 
	  surprisingly similar cultures. This fusion has pushed me to learn 2 languages 
	  since I was a kid - English (the most commonly spoken language in Ghana) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi">Hindi</a>.</p>
